# How you code and solve problems
## APPROACH
There are 4 elements in the input and output array.

For the i’th element in the input array , the output is the product of the rest 3 elements.

Ex:

input : array = [5, 1, 4, 2]

For the 1st element the output is 1×4×2=8

Similarly for 2nd element the output is 5×4×2=40

So the output is 

Output : [8, 40, 10, 20]
## CODE EXECUTION
There is a python code run.py which has this function out() which returns the required output.

change the input array and execute the python code to get the output array
